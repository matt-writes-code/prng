# frontend
## 1. mockup in photoshop (output)
- design
- define output

## 2. componentize
- break it into small parts
### 2.1 separate dynamic and static components
- dynamic = will change without interaction with backend (? does redux take this away?)
- static = only outputs stuff from backend

## 3. build static components
- e.g. in React [(tut codepen)](https://codepen.io/panzerstadt/pen/WJgYeq?editors=0010#0)

> Now that you have your component hierarchy, it’s time to implement your app. The easiest way is to build a version that takes your data model and renders the UI but has no interactivity. It’s best to decouple these processes because building a static version requires a lot of typing and no thinking, and adding interactivity requires a lot of thinking and not a lot of typing. We’ll see why. - Dan Abramov of Redux and create-react-app

# backend
## 1. write output, either as json or other
- define output
